Core Components
1. Market Selection & Filtering

Market scanner: Continuously pull available markets from Polymarket's API
Relevance filter: Use an LLM to classify markets by category (politics, sports, crypto, etc.) and filter for ones where you have data/edge
Liquidity checker: Filter for markets with sufficient volume and narrow spreads
Time horizon filter: Focus on markets with optimal time-to-resolution (not too short for research, not too long to tie up capital)

2. Information Gathering & Analysis

News aggregator: Pull relevant news/data for selected markets using web search APIs
LLM synthesizer: Have the LLM read and synthesize information into a coherent analysis
Base rate calculator: Extract historical data and calculate base rates for similar events
Sentiment analyzer: Gauge market sentiment and identify potential overreactions

3. Prediction Generation

Multi-perspective prompting: Ask the LLM to argue both sides of the market
Calibrated probability estimation: Train/prompt the LLM to give well-calibrated probabilities
Ensemble approach: Run multiple LLM calls with different prompts and average results
Uncertainty quantification: Have the LLM express confidence intervals

4. Risk Management

Position sizing: Kelly criterion or fractional Kelly based on edge and confidence
Portfolio constraints: Max exposure per market category, max total exposure
Stop-loss rules: Exit positions if new information significantly changes the picture
Diversification: Ensure you're not overly concentrated in correlated markets

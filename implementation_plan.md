this is for the most basic trading bot:

1) market filtering
- relevance filter will be for later when we figure out what kinda events we wanna trade in
- check that there's signficant liquidity/volume in the market (if we trade on illiquid events there is high slippage and it's harder to trade)
- time horizon filter
(liquidity, volume, time -- will give our initial filters)

2) basic trade idea selection

3) paper trading system
